# Movie-Trailer-Project 

A simple movie trailer website project for Udacity's full-stack [nanodegree program]. The project demonstrates the use of a Movie object class in Python to generate a static webpage, which displays a listing of favorite movies and links each movie to its trailers video on YouTube. The project also includes some CSS and jQuery involved in the display of the webpage.
